# Inventory Management and Demand Forecasting System 📈📦

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an inventory management and demand forecasting system for an e-commerce website. The system employs Random Forest, a machine learning algorithm, to predict product demand and optimize inventory levels. Additionally, it considers temperature-sensitive products to optimize storage conditions in the warehouse. ❄️

## Project Steps 🛠️

The project is organized into the following key steps:

### 1. Setup 🚀

- **Libraries Installation**: Install various Python libraries to support data analysis and machine learning.

### 2. Data Loading 📊

- **Data Source**: Data is loaded from three different datasets stored on Google Drive.

### 3. Data Cleaning 🧹

- **Null Value Handling**: Look for and address any null values.
- **Timestamp Conversion**: Convert timestamps to the desired format.

### 4. Merge Data 📂

- Merge relevant columns from the three datasets to create a unified dataset.

### 5. Feature Engineering 🧬

- Create features based on timestamps, including day and hour.

### 6. Modeling 🤖

- Utilize the Random Forest algorithm to predict demand and optimize inventory levels.
- Focus on hourly restocking of data.
